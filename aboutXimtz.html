          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Ximena Martinez, and I am currently in my 6th semester studying architecture at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico. Although I was born in Monterrey, I have been living in Cancun for a long time due to my parents' job, and I recently returned to pursue my studies.</p>

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
<p>Since I was young, I have felt a deep connection to architecture and urban design. My parents used to take me to explore different cities, and every time I saw a new building or an interesting structure, my mind would fill with ideas and possibilities.
   <br>My passion for art and creativity has also influenced my approach to architecture. I enjoy exploring different artistic styles and movements, and I seek to incorporate that diversity into my architectural designs.
   <br> In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies. I love art, books, sports, and socializing with new people.
    </p>
          <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
          <p>
            My dream job is to someday run my own architectural firm and possibly own a hotel. I have always dreamed of creating a utopian society where everyone is treated equally, and cities are designed to be functional for the future, promoting sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity.
