          <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
          <p>I enjoy running and cycling. Both of them are really nice sports.</p>
          <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
          <p>It's difficult to say, but I made the question so I have to answer it ðŸ˜…. I would like to be a UX/UI designer. I'd like to know more about user' psychology. I find it cool to see how a user navigates through a prototype.</p>
          <h2>What is for you your future city?</h2>
          <p>My future city is a futuristic, but green city with flying cars. I would love to see a way to quickly navigate to many countries, so I can meet new people.</p>
